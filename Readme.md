T(ic) T(ac) T(oe) Library in Java!
==================================

TTT is a Tic Tac Toe library for Java. I created it as a practice assignment during my residency at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/). It's a mostly congruent port of my [Ruby TTT lib](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ttt). There are two interfaces you can play it through the [command line](https://github.com/JoshCheek/java-ttt-cli) or the [internet](https://github.com/JoshCheek/java-ttt-web-interface).
